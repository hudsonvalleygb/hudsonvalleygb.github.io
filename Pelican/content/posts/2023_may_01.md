As a native Yew Yorker, Ghostbusters holds a special place in my heart, and it has become an iconic part of NYC's pop culture history. Here's what Ghostbusters means to me and my native land.

Ghostbusters is a wonderful time capsule of the 1980s. it brings back memories of the city's unique atmosphere, distinctive skyline, and bustling streets. Ghostbusters captures the essence of New York City of that that era, and it stands as one of the best film examples of its time. It is itself a cultural landmark for the city as it features no iconic locations, such as the firehouse in Tribeca that served as the Ghostbusters' HQ, the renowned New York Public Library where the boys first encounter a spirit, and Central Park West where the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man wreaked his sugary-sweet havoc. These locations are instantly recognizable to New Yorkers, and all of these locations, and many more, are regular haunts of the many Ghostbusters fans who visit NYC.

While Ghostbusters is known for its humor, what really resonates with New Yorkers is its dry wit and irreverent nature. The film's one-liners, repeatable catchphrases, and comedic performances have become part of New York City's comedic lore. Ghostbusters is often quoted in everyday conversations (and not just by fans!) and its humor is appreciated by New Yorkers who recognize nods to their Gotham perspective.

Ghostbusters presents New York City as a hotbed of paranormal activity, with ghosts and supernatural creatures roaming the streets and buildings. For New Yorkers, who are used to the city's larger-than-life reputation, and many local legends, the idea of ghosts in the Big Apple is both thrilling and imaginable. Ghostbusters portrays New York City as a unique and fantastical place where anything can happen, even ghostly encounters, adding to the city's mystique.

Ghostbusters also represents New Yorkers' resilience in the face of adversity. In the film, they are portrayed as ordinary New Yorkers who band together to combat supernatural threats and eventually save the city from destruction. This theme of teamwork, bravery, and overcoming challenges resonates with New Yorkers, who have a reputation from their shared history for their hardiness in the face of adversity.

Ghostbusters holds a special place in the heart of this New Yorker, as a nostalgic, cultural, and comedic landmark that represents the city's unique atmosphere, humor, and toughness. It has become a part of new York City's pop culture fabric, and its legacy continues to be celebrated by New Yorkers and fans around the world.

So, who ya gonna call?

_Editor's Note_: Maybe a lot of you quote Ghostbusters without even knowing it. Apparently, the idiom of something being toast first entered the lexicon after Bill Murray's [ad-lib in Ghostbusters](https://www.looper.com/1207808/the-idiom-that-ghostbusters-created-all-those-years-ago-is-still-used-today/){target="_blank"}.
