The Hudson Valley Ghostbusters want to wish everyone a Happy Pride Month! With Pride Month comes celebration and joy; however, it's also important to acknowledge the struggle that those in the LGBTQ+ community face, especially BIPOC members of the community. LGBTQ+ people are subject to discrimination and hate, and these are just some of the reasons why Pride is so important. It's important to acknowledge the struggle while still celebrating our authentic selves!

Organizations such as The Trevor Project, The American Foundation For Suicide Prevention, GLAAD, and many others have been working towards reshaping and increasing support and acceptance. We here at Hudson Valley Ghostbusters partner with organizations such as The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention in hopes of helping to create the change that is needed.

We are so proud of everyone in the LGBTQ+ community for being their authentic selves. We wish everyone a safe and happy Pride Month!

Here are some great organizations and resources to check out:
