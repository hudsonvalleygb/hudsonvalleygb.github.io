What a strange year 2020 has been, but we here at HVGB are used to strange, I suppose. While our in-person fundraising came to a screeching halt earlier this year, we haven't forgotten our mission to help the Hudson Valley. Each year, we have had the great pleasure of making some Christmas wishes come true for a family in need through the [Fearless! (formerly Safe Homes)](https://fearlesshv.org/){target="_blank"} adopt a family program. This year, we knew we needed to do more, so we adopted 2 families! Our friends and family all came together to fulfill the wishlists of six children, and then some. We are truly fortunate to be able to do the work we do and we are grateful for the continued support of our fans and friends in the Ghostbusters community. Wishing you and yours the happiest of holidays and a healthy new year, from all of us at Hudson Valley Ghostbusters.
