Introducting the Ecto-4WD. This 2007 Hummer H3 was built on the format from the video game Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime. As in the name 4WD, it is an all-terrain vehicle large enough to carry 4 Ghostbusters, their packs, and a variety of Ghostbusting equipment. At present, this impressive vehicle has an exterior lighting and sound system including the Ecto siren and lightbars. It also has removable equipment including, but not limited to, a large-scale muon trap and two sentry particle throwers.

Slimer and Muncher don't stand a chance when the Ecto-4WD is on their trail!
