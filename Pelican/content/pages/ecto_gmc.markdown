Introducing the Ecto-GMC! A 2017 GMC Terrain STL with versatile handling, 3.6L V6 engine, and all wheel drive capabilities, making it an excellent Ghostbusting vehicle for the Hudson Valley's diverse landscape and weather. With its added ghost detecting equipment on the rack, it's able to identify potential paranormal activity in the immediate area. It can fit up to four and a half Ghostbusters, 3 proton packs, ghost traps, PKE meters, and various other gizmos. Beware, Mini-Pufts are known to haunt this particular HVGB vehicle!

This Ecto-GMC has the tools, and the Hudson Valley Ghostbusters have the talent!
