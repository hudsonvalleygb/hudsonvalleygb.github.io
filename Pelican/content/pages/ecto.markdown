Any Ghostbusters team needs reliable transport to get them from HQ to spectral disturbances. While the '59 Cadillac ambulance worked great for the original Ghostbusters team in NYC, the terrain of the Hudson Valley can be extremely varied, from the paved roads of Poughkeepsie to the mountainous trails of the Adirondacks. HVGB team leader and lifelong Hudson Valley resident Matt Bennett realized that the vehicle used by HVGB needed to be able to cover a lot of different ground. As such, a 2016 Toyota Tacoma TRD Off Road with 4 wheel drive and a 4 door cab was selected.  

Christened the Ecto 1G, the once plain white Tacoma pick-up went through a major overhaul. The iconic "no ghost" logo was added to the doors, hood, and tailgate. Caution stripes run the length of the truck, with contact info on the front and rear fenders. A Code 3 MX 7000 lightbar and the instantly recognizable "Ecto siren" were added to the roof.  An over the bed rack with all the necessary ghost detecting equipment (lovingly called the Specter Detector) keeps HVGB well apprised of any supernatural occurrences within a 30 mile radius of the Ecto.  

With room to carry up to 5 Ghostbusters, along with all their proton pack, traps, PKE meters, etc., the Ecto has become an indispensable addition to the Hudson Valley Ghostbusters.  

Whether on the way to tangling with class five full roaming vapors, or to public events for charity, HVGB will always have a reliable ride to get them where they need to be.  

The fact that it also looks cool is just a bonus!
